# BIM470_Project
Building a NN to classify shapes in Matlab

This project is for the Neural Networks course BIM470 at our school. The project's aim is to build a convolutional neural network from scratch using matlab software. The neural network is going to be used to classify 3 different shapes: a horizontal rectangle, a vertical rectange, and a circle.
